My website is a website that any people can use to educate people on apple and how they became what they are today.My target users are blind people because i did input readings that blind poeople can use.

The features i am most proud of is the swapping between buttons.Changing the image,text,and color of text.

what i would add if i had more time is a couple more accessibility tools that maybe deaf people can use or people that are paralyzed and cant move much.

An accessibility feature i added was a readaloud so that blind people can hear what they are imaging in their head.
