      <p class="card-text">Apple began in the mid-1970s when two college dropouts, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, along with their friend Ronald Wayne, came together in Cupertino, California, to create and sell personal computers.

      The story of Apple's founding revolves around the passion and ingenuity of its co-founders. Steve Jobs, with his vision for user-friendly technology, and Steve Wozniak, with his engineering prowess, complemented each other perfectly. Jobs had the idea to sell a computer circuit board, while Wozniak was the technical genius who designed the Apple I computer, which was first introduced in 1976.</p>
